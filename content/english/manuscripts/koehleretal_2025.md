Examining messenger credibility in preventing and countering violent extremism.

<!--more-->

## Abstract

This study examines messenger credibility in preventing and countering violent extremism (P/CVE), comparing lived experience (i.e. former extremist and victims of terrorism) messengers to professional experts using experimental data from a representative German sample (N = 2004). Findings suggest institutional messengers may be more credible due to professional expertise, challenging assumptions about lived experience credibility. Replicating a UK study with a refined design, this research enhances understanding of P/CVE messenger credibility, offering key insights for policy and P/CVE communication strategies.

> Findings suggest institutional messengers may be more credible due to professional expertise, challenging assumptions about lived experience credibility.
