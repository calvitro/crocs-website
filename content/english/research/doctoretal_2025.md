A report on the logic and emerging trends in terrorist use of UAS.

<!--more-->

## Project Overview

In support of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the interdisciplinary project team conducted a one-year study to characterize the logic and emerging trends in terrorist use of unmanned aerial systems (UAS). The project team completed three rapid review reports which focus on key dimensions of the issue. Following the completion of these reports, the team hosted an in-person subject matter expert focus group meeting in spring 2025. The interagency workshop brought together counterterrorism and counter-UAS partners from federal and state law enforcement as well as the intelligence community. This report identifies five core findings â€“ i.e., high level analytical conclusions suggested from the completed research activities.

## Core Findings
- Practitioner Focus on Targets and Related Vulnerabilities 
- Open-Source Knowledge and DIY Tools Are Facilitating UAS Acquisition and Adaptation
- Domestic Counter-UAS Efforts Are Hindered by Legal and Structural Gaps 
- Advancements in Drone Technology Are Expanding the Threat Spectrum
- UAS Supply Chains Require Greater Scrutiny and Disruption
