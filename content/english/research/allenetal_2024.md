## Executive Summary
Between 2015 and 2022, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) provided $60 million through the Targeted Violence and Terrorism Prevention (TVTP) Grant Program to help communities across the United States develop capabilities to combat terrorism and targeted violence. Managed by the Center for Prevention Programs and Partnerships (CP3), the program provides grant funding to state, local, tribal, and territorial governments, nonprofits, and institutions of higher education to enhance the capabilities of locally based TVTP programs through a public health-informed, whole-of-society approach. Building local prevention capacity is a key federal policy priority, and the TVTP Grant Program possesses unique characteristics that differentiate it from other federal violence protection grant programs. 

In support of the Grant Program, the DHS Science and Technology Directorate (DHS S&T) requested the National Counterterrorism Innovation, Technology, and Education Center (NCITE) conduct an evaluation of the TVTP Grant Program. This report contains the results of that program evaluation and recommendations to position the TVTP Grant Program for long-term success. Specifically, this report discusses the (a) data collection activities to support our program evaluation and (b) results of those activities. 

## Report Goals
We specified and delivered on the following three goals: 
- Examine TVTP Grant Program procedures (e.g., for grant award, monitoring) to summarize key successes, challenges, and opportunities. This constitutes a process evaluation.
- Assess the evidence of grant program effectiveness using data available from grant recipients across fiscal years 2016, 2020, 2021, and 2022. This constitutes an outcome evaluation. 
- Provide recommendations for enhancing TVTP Grant Program implementation in the future.
