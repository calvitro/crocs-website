A report on language use of those who share conspiracy beliefs online.

<!--more-->

## Project Overview

We know little about the individuals who share conspiracy beliefs online. By examining their language use, we can gain more insight into this population. We find that several language markers are associated with higher levels of conspiracy mentality, that is, a generic tendency to engage in conspiracy thinking. This has important implications for countering the impact of conspiracy theories and preventing support for election violence, a pathway we examine in a separate report.
