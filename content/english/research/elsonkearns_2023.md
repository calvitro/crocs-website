A report on developing and testing a chatbot to help with reporting.

## Project Overview

Effective terrorism and targeted violence (TTY) prevention and intervention relies upon members of the public to report concerning behavior they observe. Yet, there are multiple points during the process of identifying and sharing information about potential TTY threats where breakdowns can occur, hindering intervention efforts resulting in deadly consequences. This project's overarching aim was to improve the tips reporting process to minimize breakdowns in actions required to intervene and prevent TTY. Specifically, with this IVTP innovation grant, we developed and tested evidence-informed chatbot technologies to improve TTY tips reporting. In the IMP, we listed three project goals with objectives and activities under each. Below we summarize these goals, the stated objectives, and what we completed for the project.
