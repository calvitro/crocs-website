The current state of U.S. federal cases against ISIS

<!--more-->

## Project Overview

The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) is a transnational Salafi-jihadist terrorist group, designated as a foreign terrorist organization (FTO) by the U.S. Department of State. Since 2014 when the leader of ISIS declared the global caliphate, 263 individuals have been federally charged with ISIS-related crimes in U.S. courts. Since ISIS is a designated FTO, most cases (72.6%) involving ISIS-related activity are resolved using the material support to terrorism statute. This brief summarizes the scope of federal court cases related to ISIS in the U.S. since 2014.
