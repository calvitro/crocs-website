Graduate student <a href=/team/brooke-buxton>Brooke Buxton</a> received funding to support their project: *Pathways to prevention: Familial law enforcement approaches to radicalization intervention.*

<!--more--> 

**The proposed research study will examine barriers experienced by family members of radicalizing individuals, as well as law enforcement approaches to countering violent extremism. The goal of this research is to understand how family- and law enforcement-based interventions differ and how they affect the outcome of radicalization. The findings will contribute to a growing body of literature on family involvement in counterterrorism practices, and how these can be improved upon with strong community relations by law enforcement agencies.**

Funding for this project comes from the UNO Office of Research and Creative Activity Graduate Research and Creative Activity (GRACA) grant. Brooke will be supported in this project by faculty mentor <a href=/team/erin-kearns>Dr. Erin Kearns</a>.
