**This research proposal intends to investigate the U.S. public’s perception of mass shootings and identify their current attitudes regarding different policy solutions to mass shootings. Focus will be placed on the public’s opinions of the potential implementation of policy interventions aimed at reducing mass shootings, as well as the public’s general views on the U.S. federal and state governments’ current efforts to address them.**

Funding for this project comes from the UNO Office of Research and Creative Activity Graduate Research and Creative Activity (GRACA) grant. Allison will be supported in this project by faculty mentor <a href=/team/erin-kearns>Dr. Erin Kearns</a>.
