Graduate Research Assistant

<!--more-->

I am a graduate research assistant at the University of Nebraska at Omaha (UNO). I hold a bachelor’s degree in sociology and a master’s degree in criminology and criminal justice. I am currently working toward my PhD at the UNO School of Criminology and Criminal Justice. I have three years’ worth of research experience, including both quantitative and qualitative research methods. I focus on research which I hope will address extremist violence in the United States. I think human behavior is endlessly fascinating, and I want to better understand the factors that lead people down different paths.
