Research Associate
<!--more-->
Brenna Helm is a research associate at the National Counterterrorism Innovation, Technology, and Education (NCITE) Center, as well as a Doctoral Candidate (ABD) in the School of Criminal Justice at Michigan State University. She holds appointments as a 2023 RSA Security Scholar and fellow at the Institute for Research on Male Supremacism (IRMS).

Helm’s expertise is centered around extremism and extremists’ use of the Internet with a particular interest in pathways to engagement, the role of gender within extremist movements, and extremist subcultures and communities online. She aims to support the development of interventions and disengagement initiatives though developing a deeper understanding of how behavioral mechanisms manifest both on- and offline, as well as how they vary across digital modalities.

Her work has appeared in the Journal of Crime and Justice, Deviant Behavior, Sociological Focus, and in Critical Criminology. Her work has also been featured in the VOX-Pol Network of Excellence Blog and the Global Network on Extremism & Terrorism (GNET) Insights.
