Research on unmanned systems (UxS) and the current state of terrorist innovation in this emerging space.

<!--more-->

## Project Overview

The National Counterterrorism Innovation, Technology, and Education (NCITE) Center has been tasked by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to study terrorist innovation and develop frameworks that can be used to understand and mitigate malign use of geospatial technologies. In partnership with the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), the NCITE team will examine the current state of terrorist innovation in this emerging space and explore near-future possibilities that federal, state, local, and tribal authorities may confront. In particular, the research team will identify how emerging geospatial technologies may be used by terrorists and violent extremists to support or execute physical attacks against critical infrastructure, namely the energy and agriculture sectors.
