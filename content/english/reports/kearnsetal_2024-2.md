Report on Behavioral Threat Assessment and Management (BTAM) program guides.

<!--more-->

## Project Overview

Across the country, Behavioral Threat Assessment and Management (BTAM) teams exist in communities, education settings, workplaces, and other environments with the aim to assess potential concerns, connect individuals with resources they need, and prevent violence. Despite the prevalence of BTAM teams, there is little available guidance on how to setup and implement these teams in communities. The Review of BTAM Program Setup and Implementation Guides Report is one deliverable in a larger project to (a) evaluate the effectiveness of the DHS I&A NTER Program Officeâ€™s Master Trainer Program (MTP) in meeting its objectives, and (b) provide research and recommendations to enhance program outcomes.

> Our main objective was to better understand current policies and procedures to screen for and identify insider threats in the hiring process and among active officers.
