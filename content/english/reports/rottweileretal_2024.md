Research report on election conspiracy beliefs and electoral violence.

<!--more-->

## Overview

An increase in election violence in the United States following the 2020 presidential election has led to a renewed interest in the connection between belief in conspiracy theories around elections and the potential for real-world violence. Given that elections are part of U.S. critical infrastructure, we consider how conspiracy theories may contribute to threats around elections. The research team examined the impact of election fraud conspiracy beliefs on individualsâ€™ willingness to engage in election violence using a large-scale population survey. The team tested whether various individual or community factors increase or mitigate the likelihood of election violence. The results of this research will inform early prevention efforts by practitioners to combat the spread of election-related conspiracy beliefs and the threat of electoral violence.
