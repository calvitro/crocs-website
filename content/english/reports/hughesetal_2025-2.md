## Project Overview

The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) is a transnational Salafi-jihadist terrorist group, designated as a foreign terrorist organization (FTO) by the U.S. Department of State . A review by NCITE has found that 261 individuals with significant ties to the United States have been charged with ISIS-related activities since 2014. These individuals come from 36 states and Washington D.C., with at least 205 individuals having pled guilty or been found guilty by trial. The average sentence for these individuals is 13 years. Of those charged, 234 are male, and 26 are female. The average age at the time of arrest was 26 years old.
